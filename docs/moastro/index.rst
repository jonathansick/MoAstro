The Mo'Astro Documentation
==========================

Mo'Astro is a MongoDB framework for observational astronomy pipelines.
Mo'Astro provides tools for building collections of FITS image metadata, and provides a place for pipelines to persist metadata producs.
Mo'Astro also provides facilities for batch processing images with the Astromatic tool suite, and for hosting a local 2MASS star catalog with spatial-search built-in.

Mo'Astro is built by `Jonathan Sick <http://jonathansick.ca>`_ for the ANDROIDS survey fo M31.
Please cite `arXiv:1303.6290 <http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6290>`_ if you make use of this project, or its derivatives, in your own research.
I'd also love to hear from you.
