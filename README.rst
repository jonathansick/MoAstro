Mo'Astro
========

A `MongoDB`_ framework for observational astronomy.
`Mo'Astro`_ helps you setup a MongoDB collection of your survey's image set,
keeping FITS metadata readily available, and providing a place for your
reduction pipeline to persist metadata. `Mo'Astro`_ also provides tools to
work with batches of image with the Astromatic reduction suite.
